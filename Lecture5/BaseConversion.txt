BinaryToDecimal --> to Decimal --> % 10, /10 and  mult * 2 <-- From

DecimalToBinary --> To --> /2 , % 2 and * 10 <-- From

The above rules will not work if there is no decimal base involved

If we want to go from a base to base that is not decimal
                 then
   we will have to go from that base to decimal first and then decimal to the desired base
