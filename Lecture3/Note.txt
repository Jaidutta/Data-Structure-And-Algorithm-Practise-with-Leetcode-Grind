General rules for mirror
1. Unless there is number, vertical mirror must be ignored
2. Bad wala space hamesha ignore kare look at pattern 9
3. If there is number or $ or anything, first try making the *  pattern and then start working on it
4. i++ should be the last statement in a mirror

To balance an extra star, look at pattern 19
